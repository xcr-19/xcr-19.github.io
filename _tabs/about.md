# Whoami

Hi, I’m Chandan!

I’m a cybersecurity researcher specializing in offensive security, malware development, and red teaming. I have a deep passion for tackling CTF challenges and solving red team labs, which continually push me to hone my skills and stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.

I started this blog to both track my journey in cybersecurity and share insights with others. My goal is to create a space for knowledge-sharing and exposure, all while documenting the things I’m learning and working on.

Outside of tech, I enjoy spending quality time with my friends, exploring different cultures, and discovering new things at museums. I’m also a proud cat parent, and I find joy in taking care of them.

I’m always excited to connect with others in the cybersecurity space and beyond, and I look forward to sharing my adventures—both in cybersecurity and in life—with you!
